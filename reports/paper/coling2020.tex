\section{Introduction}

Dictionaries are great sources of information related to languages.
They contain a lot of information regarding meanings (senses) of words.
As language evolves, senses of words change and dictionaries need to be updated accordingly.
Dictionary writers constantly work on manually detecting semantic changes in current usage.
This is a very time-consuming and expensive process.

In this work, I propose a method to automatically detect semantic changes in words by leveraging the contextualizing power of deep language models.
I use BERT~\cite{devlin-etal-2019-bert} to contextualize words in a corpus and compare their contextualized representations to detect semantic changes.

\section{System Description}

\subsection{Data}

I use free samples of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)~\cite{english-corpora-2008-coca} and the NOW corpus (News on the Web)~\cite{english-corpora-2016-now} as my two corpora.
The COCA's sample has 8.9 million words and NOW has 1.7 million words.
Its content ranges from academic usage to fiction and spoken language.
Since the task is detecting current semantic changes, the corpus should be recent.
